# Spotify-Requests

This web app uses the Spotify Web API and the AudD Music Recognition API to fetch and display music data, including identifying songs from audio streams. The project focuses on practicing API integration, asynchronous data fetching, and dynamic UI rendering using React.


# Features
- Allows users to log in to their Spotify account
- Identifies songs from audio streams using the AudD Music Recognition API
- Fetches and displays song and artist information using the Spotify Web API
- Provides music recommendations based on identified or selected songs


# Technical Implementation
- Uses the useEffect() React hook for data fetching and lifecycle management
- Implements async/await for handling asynchronous API calls
- Handles conditional rendering based on authentication and fetched data
- Renders reusable components to display music data
- Dynamically updates content based on user interaction and API responses


## Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript 
- HTML / CSS
- Spotify Web API
- AudD API


## Notes

One of the main challenges was working with the Spotify API and understanding the structure of the data returned from different endpoints. Debugging asynchronous requests and ensuring components rendered correctly required careful testing and verification. This project helped strengthen my understanding of API integration, state management, and component-based design in React.
This project began with starter code provided through the Snap Engineering Academy and was further developed to include additional API integrations, features, and improvements.
